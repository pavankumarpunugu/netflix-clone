# Netlify Deployment Guide for Netflix Clone

## âœ“ Your Project is Ready for Netlify!

I've optimized your Netflix clone specifically for Netlify deployment:

### What I've Prepared:
- âœ“ Converted to static frontend-only application
- âœ“ Replaced backend API calls with local mock data
- âœ“ Added netlify.toml configuration file
- âœ“ Configured proper build settings
- âœ“ Set up client-side routing

## Simple Deployment Steps:

### Method 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest)

1. **Download your project:**
   - In Replit: Click the â‹® menu â†’ "Download as zip"
   - Extract the zip file on your computer

2. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Sign up/login with GitHub or email
   - Drag and drop your project folder to the deploy area
   - Netlify will automatically build and deploy!

### Method 2: GitHub Integration

1. **Upload to GitHub** (if you want continuous deployment):
   - Create new repository on GitHub
   - Upload your project files
   - Connect to Netlify for auto-deploys

2. **Netlify Configuration:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Node version: 18

## Your Live App Will Have:

âœ“ **Full Netflix UI** - Dark theme, responsive design
âœ“ **Movie & TV Show browsing** - All pages working
âœ“ **Search functionality** - Search through content
âœ“ **Video player simulation** - Mock playback controls
âœ“ **Add to List feature** - Local storage-based
âœ“ **Mobile responsive** - Works on all devices

## After Deployment:

- Your app will be available at: `https://your-app-name.netlify.app`
- Free SSL certificate included
- Fast global CDN
- Custom domain support available

## Files Configured for Netlify:

- `netlify.toml` - Deployment configuration
- `client/src/lib/mockData.ts` - Local content data
- Updated pages to work without backend

Your Netflix clone is production-ready for static hosting! ðŸŽ¬

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the Netlify build logs
2. Ensure all file paths are correct
3. Verify the build completes successfully

The app uses mock data, so it works perfectly without any backend or database setup needed!
